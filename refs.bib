@article{Smyth04,
  abstract =     {The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in
                  designed microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and
                  Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of
                  differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment
                  using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of
                  this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt
                  and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general
                  microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments
                  and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general
                  linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of
                  interest. The approach applies equally well to both single
                  channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent,
                  closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in
                  the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even
                  for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data
                  arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The
                  posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a
                  moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard
                  deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations.
                  The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the
                  estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate,
                  resulting in far more stable inference when the number of
                  arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the
                  advantage over the posterior odds that the number of
                  hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in
                  particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold
                  changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown
                  to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom.
                  The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate
                  tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of
                  moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is
                  demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for
                  two publicly available data sets.},

@article{Husmeier03,
  abstract =     {MOTIVATION: Bayesian networks have been applied to infer
                  genetic regulatory interactions from microarray gene
                  expression data. This inference problem is particularly hard
                  in that interactions between hundreds of genes have to be
                  learned from very small data sets, typically containing only a
                  few dozen time points during a cell cycle. Most previous
                  studies have assessed the inference results on real gene
                  expression data by comparing predicted genetic regulatory
                  interactions with those known from the biological literature.
                  This approach is controversial due to the absence of known
                  gold standards, which renders the estimation of the
                  sensitivity and specificity, that is, the true and
                  (complementary) false detection rate, unreliable and
                  difficult. The objective of the present study is to test the
                  viability of the Bayesian network paradigm in a realistic
                  simulation study. First, gene expression data are simulated
                  from a realistic biological network involving DNAs, mRNAs,
                  inactive protein monomers and active protein dimers. Then,
                  interaction networks are inferred from these data in a reverse
                  engineering approach, using Bayesian networks and Bayesian
                  learning with Markov chain Monte Carlo. RESULTS: The
                  simulation results are presented as receiver operator
                  characteristics curves. This allows estimating the proportion
                  of spurious gene interactions incurred for a specified target
                  proportion of recovered true interactions. The findings
                  demonstrate how the network inference performance varies with
                  the training set size, the degree of inadequacy of prior
                  assumptions, the experimental sampling strategy and the
                  inclusion of further, sequence-based information.

  abstract =     {In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density
                  oligonucleotide array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip system
                  with the objective of improving upon currently used measures
                  of gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets:
                  a small experimental study consisting of five MGU74A mouse
                  GeneChip arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in
                  study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute
                  involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip arrays; and part of a
                  dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A
                  GeneChip arrays. We display some familiar features of the
                  perfect match and mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these
                  data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with
                  probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so
                  delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the
                  arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then
                  examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike-in data and
                  assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i)
                  average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii)
                  the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index
                  (MBEI). The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data
                  motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi-array
                  average (RMA) of background-adjusted, normalized, and
                  log-transformed PM values. We evaluate the four expression
                  summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing
                  their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for MBEI and
                  RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms
                  of their ability to detect known levels of differential
                  expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is
                  no obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard
                  error (SE) to this quantity using a linear model which removes
                  probe-specific affinities.},

                  methods for Affymetrix microarray data on expression
                  quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, using 14 CEPH Utah
                  families (GAW Problem 1 data). Different sets of expression
                  traits were chosen according to different selection criteria:
                  expression level, variance, and heritability. For each gene,
                  three expression phenotypes were obtained by different
                  pre-processing methods. Each quantitative phenotype was then
                  submitted to a whole-genome scan, using multipoint variance
                  component LODs. Pre-processing methods were compared with
                  respect to their linkage outcomes (number of linkage signals
                  with LODs greater than 3, consistencies in the location of the
                  trait-specific linkage signals, and type of
                  cis/trans-regulating loci). Overall, we found little agreement
                  between linkage results from the different pre-processing
                  methods: most of the linkage signals were specific to one
                  pre-processing method. However, agreement rates varied
                  according to the criteria used to select the traits. For
                  instance, these rates were higher in the set of the most
                  heritable traits. On the other hand, the pre-processing method
                  had little impact on the relative proportion of detected cis
                  and trans-regulating loci. Interestingly, although the number
                  of detected cis-regulating loci was relatively small,
                  pre-processing methods agreed much better in this set of
                  linkage signals than in the trans-regulating loci. Several
                  potential factors explaining the discordance observed between
                  the methods are discussed.},

  abstract =     {MOTIVATION: Genetic networks are often described statistically
                  using graphical models (e.g. Bayesian networks). However,
                  inferring the network structure offers a serious challenge in
                  microarray analysis where the sample size is small compared to
                  the number of considered genes. This renders many standard
                  algorithms for graphical models inapplicable, and inferring
                  genetic networks an 'ill-posed' inverse problem. METHODS: We
                  introduce a novel framework for small-sample inference of
                  graphical models from gene expression data. Specifically, we
                  focus on the so-called graphical Gaussian models (GGMs) that
                  are now frequently used to describe gene association networks
                  and to detect conditionally dependent genes. Our new approach
                  is based on (1) improved (regularized) small-sample point
                  estimates of partial correlation, (2) an exact test of edge
                  inclusion with adaptive estimation of the degree of freedom
                  and (3) a heuristic network search based on false discovery
                  rate multiple testing. Steps (2) and (3) correspond to an
                  empirical Bayes estimate of the network topology. RESULTS:
                  Using computer simulations, we investigate the sensitivity
                  (power) and specificity (true negative rate) of the proposed
                  framework to estimate GGMs from microarray data. This shows
                  that it is possible to recover the true network topology with
                  high accuracy even for small-sample datasets. Subsequently, we
                  analyze gene expression data from a breast cancer tumor study
                  and illustrate our approach by inferring a corresponding
                  large-scale gene association network for 3883 genes.},

  abstract =     {Clustering is an important tool in microarray data analysis.
                  This unsupervised learning technique is commonly used to
                  reveal structures hidden in large gene expression data sets.
                  The vast majority of clustering algorithms applied so far
                  produce hard partitions of the data, i.e. each gene is
                  assigned exactly to one cluster. Hard clustering is favourable
                  if clusters are well separated. However, this is generally not
                  the case for microarray time-course data, where gene clusters
                  frequently overlap. Additionally, hard clustering algorithms
                  are often highly sensitive to noise. To overcome the
                  limitations of hard clustering, we applied soft clustering
                  which offers several advantages for researchers. First, it
                  generates accessible internal cluster structures, i.e. it
                  indicates how well corresponding clusters represent genes.
                  This can be used for the more targeted search for regulatory
                  elements. Second, the overall relation between clusters, and
                  thus a global clustering structure, can be defined.
                  Additionally, soft clustering is more noise robust and a
                  priori pre-filtering of genes can be avoided. This prevents
                  the exclusion of biologically relevant genes from the data
                  analysis. Soft clustering was implemented here using the fuzzy
                  c-means algorithm. Procedures to find optimal clustering
                  parameters were developed. A software package for soft
                  clustering has been developed based on the open-source
                  statistical language R. The package called Mfuzz is freely
                  available.},

  abstract =     {Oligonucleotide microarrays are an informative tool to
                  elucidate gene regulatory networks. In order for gene
                  expression levels to be comparable across microarrays,
                  normalization procedures have to be invoked. A large number of
                  methods have been described to correct for systematic biases
                  in microarray experiments. The performance of these methods
                  has been tested only to a limited extend. Here, we evaluate
                  two different types of microarray analyses: (i) the same gene
                  in replicate samples and (ii) different, but co-expressed
                  genes in the same sample. The reliability of the latter
                  analysis needs to be determined for the analysis of regulatory
                  networks and our report is the first attempt to evaluate for
                  the accuracy of different microarray normalization methods in
                  this respect. Consistent with previous results we observed a
                  large effect of the normalization method on the outcome of the
                  expression analyses. Our analyses indicate that different
                  normalization methods should be performed depending on whether
                  a study is aiming to detect differential gene expression
                  between independent samples or whether co-expressed genes
                  should be identified. We make recommendations about the most

  abstract =     {BACKGROUND: The use of correlation networks is widespread in
                  the analysis of gene expression and proteomics data, even
                  though it is known that correlations not only confound direct
                  and indirect associations but also provide no means to
                  distinguish between cause and effect. For "causal" analysis
                  typically the inference of a directed graphical model is
                  required. However, this is rather difficult due to the curse
                  of dimensionality. RESULTS: We propose a simple heuristic for
                  the statistical learning of a high-dimensional "causal"
                  network. The method first converts a correlation network into
                  a partial correlation graph. Subsequently, a partial ordering
                  of the nodes is established by multiple testing of the
                  log-ratio of standardized partial variances. This allows
                  identifying a directed acyclic causal network as a subgraph of
                  the partial correlation network. We illustrate the approach by
                  analyzing a large Arabidopsis thaliana expression data set.
                  CONCLUSION: The proposed approach is a heuristic algorithm
                  that is based on a number of approximations, such as
                  substituting lower order partial correlations by full order
                  partial correlations. Nevertheless, for small samples and for
                  sparse networks the algorithm not only yield sensible first
                  order approximations of the causal structure in
                  high-dimensional genomic data but is also computationally
                  highly efficient. AVAILABILITY AND REQUIREMENTS: The method is
                  implemented in the "GeneNet" R package (version 1.2.0),
                  available from CRAN and from
                  http://strimmerlab.org/software/genets/. The software includes

                  Therefore, quality assessments of RNA hybridized to

  abstract =     {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Telomeres prevent the ends of eukaryotic
                  chromosomes from being recognized as damaged DNA and protect
                  against cancer and ageing. When telomere structure is
                  perturbed, a co-ordinated series of events promote arrest of
                  the cell cycle so that cells carrying damaged telomeres do not
                  divide. In order to better understand the eukaryotic response
                  to telomere damage, budding yeast strains harboring a
                  temperature sensitive allele of an essential telomere capping
                  gene (cdc13-1) were subjected to a transcriptomic study.
                  RESULTS: The genome-wide response to uncapped telomeres in
                  yeast cdc13-1 strains, which have telomere capping defects at
                  temperatures above approximately 27 degrees C, was determined.
                  Telomere uncapping in cdc13-1 strains is associated with the
                  differential expression of over 600 transcripts. Transcripts
                  affecting responses to DNA damage and diverse environmental
                  stresses were statistically over-represented. BNA2, required
                  for the biosynthesis of NAD+, is highly and significantly
                  up-regulated upon telomere uncapping in cdc13-1 strains. We
                  find that deletion of BNA2 and NPT1, which is also involved in
                  NAD+ synthesis, suppresses the temperature sensitivity of
                  cdc13-1 strains, indicating that NAD+ metabolism may be linked
                  to telomere end protection. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the
                  hypothesis that the response to telomere uncapping is related
                  to, but distinct from, the response to non-telomeric
                  double-strand breaks. The induction of environmental stress
                  responses may be a conserved feature of the eukaryotic
                  response to telomere damage. BNA2, which is involved in NAD+
                  synthesis, plays previously unidentified roles in the cellular
                  response to telomere uncapping.},

                  quality assessment of Affymetrix GeneChip(R) soybean genome
                  data and for performing analyses to determine differential
                  gene expression using the open-source R programming
                  environment in conjunction with the open-source Bioconductor
                  software. We describe procedures for extracting those
                  Affymetrix probe set IDs related specifically to the soybean
                  genome on the Affymetrix soybean chip and demonstrate the use
                  of exploratory plots including images of raw probe-level data,
                  boxplots, density plots and M versus A plots. RNA degradation
                  and recommended procedures from Affymetrix for quality control
                  are discussed. An appropriate probe-level model provides an
                  excellent quality assessment tool. To demonstrate this, we
                  discuss and display chip pseudo-images of weights, residuals
                  and signed residuals and additional probe-level modeling plots
                  that may be used to identify aberrant chips. The Robust
                  Multichip Averaging (RMA) procedure was used for background
                  correction, normalization and summarization of the AffyBatch
                  probe-level data to obtain expression level data and to
                  discover differentially expressed genes. Examples of boxplots
                  and MA plots are presented for the expression level data.
                  Volcano plots and heatmaps are used to demonstrate the use of
                  (log) fold changes in conjunction with ordinary and moderated
                  t-statistics for determining interesting genes. We show, with
                  real data, how implementation of functions in R and
                  Bioconductor successfully identified differentially expressed
                  genes that may play a role in soybean resistance to a fungal

@article{Yu04,
  abstract =     {MOTIVATION: Network inference algorithms are powerful
                  computational tools for identifying putative causal
                  interactions among variables from observational data. Bayesian
                  network inference algorithms hold particular promise in that
                  they can capture linear, non-linear, combinatorial, stochastic
                  and other types of relationships among variables across
                  multiple levels of biological organization. However,
                  challenges remain when applying these algorithms to limited
                  quantities of experimental data collected from biological
                  systems. Here, we use a simulation approach to make advances
                  in our dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) inference algorithm,
                  especially in the context of limited quantities of biological
                  data. RESULTS: We test a range of scoring metrics and search
                  heuristics to find an effective algorithm configuration for
                  evaluating our methodological advances. We also identify
                  sampling intervals and levels of data discretization that
                  allow the best recovery of the simulated networks. We develop
                  a novel influence score for DBNs that attempts to estimate
                  both the sign (activation or repression) and relative
                  magnitude of interactions among variables. When faced with
                  limited quantities of observational data, combining our
                  influence score with moderate data interpolation reduces a
                  significant portion of false positive interactions in the
                  recovered networks. Together, our advances allow DBN inference
                  algorithms to be more effective in recovering biological
                  networks from experimentally collected data. AVAILABILITY:
